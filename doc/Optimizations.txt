1. peephole: move/arithmetic for ADD/MUL into one instruction, if
- read at most 2 registers (non-accumulators)
- dont depend on one another
- dont write same output (or have contrary conditions)
- ...


2. reorder (arithmetic) instructions to improve peephole, remove NOPs
- dont violate NOPs after branches
- dont read r4 in two instructions after SFU-call
- dont re-order over labels
- ...

3. dont write from comparisons (write to NOP), since only flags are used
- only if flags are stil set
- only if result (flag) is ONLY used from the next instruction
