Jump to Subroutine			vs.			Inlining
+ less machine code						- 2 less branches
- need to reserve X registers			+ easier register mapping
- no recursion possible					- dito
- requires calling convention (which register has which parameter/return value)
- no access to memory? so no stack possible	+ "stack-depth" = 1

OpenCL forbids recursion anyway! (see OpenCL 1.2, page 234)
