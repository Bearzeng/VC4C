### For building
C++11 compiler

### For running

#### Optional

* Clang installed (3.8/3.9)
* [SPIRV-LLVM](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-LLVM) and [SPIR-V](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIR/tree/spirv-1.0) (preferred option, lot faster)
(only clang-tblgen, clang, llvm-as and llvm-spirv need to be built)

Either one of these compilers must be installed to support direct compilation from OpenCL C source code.
