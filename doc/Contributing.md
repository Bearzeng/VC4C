## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

There are several ways you can contribute to this project, even if you don't want to get into the internals of the compiler or runtime-library:

### Tickets
The simplest way to contribute is to create a new ticket [here](https://github.com/doe300/VC4C/issues).
I accept bug-reports, remarks on how something is done, ideas for more performant code, etc.

### Pull Request
The next step after creating a ticket for a bug-fix or a new feature is to implement it yourself and create a pull-request.
Please write readable code and explain, what the PR is for.

### Kernels
If you have a kernel, that doesn't compile  or doesn't do what it is supposed to do, let me know.
For me to be able to fix the problem the fastest, I'd be pleased if you send following information:

* A short description of what doesn't behave the way it should
* A minimal example stating the problem, containing a complete working (theoretically on some other machine) kernel
* Some example input-values and the expected results or preferable a complete code-example (inclusive host-code) to run the kernel
